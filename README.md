# Next Word Prediction System

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

A Next Word Prediction system, also known as Language Modeling, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that aims to predict the most probable word(s) that would follow a given input sequence of words. The system leverages statistical patterns and semantic relationships in the language to generate the predictions.

Here's how a Next Word Prediction system typically works:

1. Training: The system is trained on a large dataset of text, known as the training corpus. During training, the system learns the statistical patterns and relationships between words in the language. It builds a language model, which captures the probability distribution of words given their context.

2. Context Window: To predict the next word, the system considers a context window of preceding words. The size of this window can vary, but commonly, a few words or the entire sentence before the target word are used as context.

3. Prediction: Given the input context, the system calculates the probabilities of each word in the vocabulary being the next word. The word with the highest probability is considered the predicted next word.

Next Word Prediction systems are widely used in various applications:

1. **Text Assistants and Auto-Completion**: They power features in text editors, messaging apps, and search engines to provide suggestions for the next word while typing. This can help users write faster and reduce typos.

2. **Speech Recognition and Virtual Assistants**: In speech recognition systems and virtual assistants like Siri or Google Assistant, language modeling helps in understanding and predicting the user's spoken language, enabling more accurate transcription and more contextually relevant responses.

3. **Machine Translation**: In machine translation systems, predicting the next word in the target language helps generate coherent and contextually appropriate translations.

4. **Chatbots**: Language modeling plays a crucial role in chatbots to understand user queries and generate appropriate responses.

5. **Natural Language Generation**: When generating human-like text, such as in storytelling or generating product descriptions, next word prediction systems can ensure that the generated text flows naturally and adheres to the language's grammar and style.

Next Word Prediction systems are designed to enhance user experience, improve productivity, and make human-computer interactions more seamless by accurately predicting the user's intended input. These systems find applications in various domains, including communication, content generation, and information retrieval, among others.


## Demo


1.Open the jupyter application

2.If jupyter is not available then install the anaconda and set up it.Then you will get the jupyter application.

3.After opening the jupyter you will be directed into the default browser.

4.Now go to the location where where you have placed the project by following the directory.

5.Now find the nextword prediction1.ipnyb file and then run it.

6.Now you need to execute the each segment to complete the execution of the project.

7.Now execute the generate_seq(model , tokenizer , 'service' , 6) function by replacing the text(service) and predictionumber(6) with the text and number that you want to predict.
